So, what does this do for you? Well, if you had this `remake.yml` file in your current working directory, and the `download_data()`, `process_data()`, and `myplot()` functions were in `code.R` (which you don't), it would look like this when you run `make` from the `remake` package

Now - adding on to this PR by pushing up additional commits - add and modify code, folders, and this remake file so you can build _your_ `figure_1.png` with `remake::make()`. Build on your existing folders, functions, and code from the previous sections. Comment in the pull request with a screenshot of the build message, like we have in the message above :point_up:
